A. Goal

The goal of our game is to escape the school
as fast as you can without running into too
many staff/faculty members, homework, or
irritating students.

In order to use the exit, you must have the
following items collected from various
rooms/locations around the school:

  - Stolen teacher ID
  - "Authentic" Doctor's Excuse
      from shady student
  - Your belongings
      - Your phone
      - Your laptop
      - Your car keys
      - Your gym clothes
      - Your deck of cards


B. Setting

The setting of our game is a random high
school (that looks a lot like J.L. Mann).

The window will be 900 wide by 700 tall.

The ground is the ISS/Detention/Dungeon
basement.

Platforms represent different hallways or
rooms.

Scenery involves things that looks
strikingly similar to J.L. Mann items.


C. Features

Running into a staff member will cause you
to be sent back to the basement.

Running into a teacher will give you more
homework, which slows you down the more
you get.

Running into a homework pass will remove
some homework.

Running into one of your items will cause
it to be "collected" and shown at the
top of the screen

Running into an irritating student will
cause you to freeze for two seconds.

    "Ready for that test later?" your friend asks as you walk down the hall.
    "What test?" you ask as s sense of foreboding seeps through you.
    "The one in Mr.Repooc's class?  You did study for it, didn't you?  He said it was
    going to be really hard."
    You flash back to last nights events: arrival home; grab Nintendo, soda, hot pocket;
    lay on bed and spend the rest of the night improving your stats in Epic Crush Frat.
    "No, I forgot," you groan.
    "How could you forget!"
    "I was busy with... important stuff."
    Your friend gives you a look.  "Dude, you are in so much trouble."

    Well, you would be if you didn't suddenly come down with a bad case of lacostuditis.
    Now all you need to do is collect your belongings: your phone (which was wrongfully
    confiscated after a major misunderstanding with a teacher), your laptop (which your
    sibling stole), and your deck of cards (which you lent to some friends who were using
    them to do a hardcore study of statistics).  You also will need to 'borrow' an
    administrators ID and pick up the "authentic" Doctor's note left for you by the
    shady kid.  After you have collected all of these things, you must make your way to
    the exit.
    Fair warning: You'll want to avoid the teachers, administrators, and annoying students
    who will very rudely, and  with no regard for your illness, hold you up and distract
    your goal.  The teachers, upon hearing that you will not be in their class, will give
    you the homework they were going to assign.  The administrators will send you to
    detention for what they call "aimless wandering" around the halls.  And the annoying
    students will start talking to you, and you being the polite person you are will have
    to stop and listen to them.
